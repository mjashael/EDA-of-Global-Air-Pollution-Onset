# Global Air Quality Analysis: A Study on NO2, O3, CO, and PM2.5 Pollutants

## Problem Statement
The project aims to explore the geolocated impact of key pollutants - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5) - on public health and environmental quality. Given the adverse effects of these pollutants, from respiratory diseases to ecosystem damage, there is a critical need to understand their distribution, sources, and potential control measures.

## Project Background
This study will utilize a comprehensive dataset to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of air pollutants. The focus will be on NO2, primarily emitted by vehicles and power plants; O3, a ground-level pollutant affecting health and vegetation; CO, an indoor and outdoor pollutant from burning fossil fuels; and PM2.5, fine particles posing serious health risks. The analysis will inform strategies to mitigate pollution and safeguard human health and the environment.

## Domain Knowledge
Air Pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.
